- In order to run these notebooks you will need a Zillow account and a Zillow Web Service Id (ZWSID). If you do not already have a ZWSID, you should register at [https://www.zillow.com/webservice/Registration.htm](https://www.zillow.com/webservice/Registration.htm) and apply forr ZWSID in your account settings. If you have forgot your ZWSID, you can ask Zillow to remind it at [http://www.zillow.com/webservice/APIReminder.htm](http://www.zillow.com/webservice/APIReminder.htm)
- Your ZWSID must be set as value of the 'zws-id' query parameter of your request.
